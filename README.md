# üîç SIEM It to Believe It: Hands-On Wazuh + Hydra Brute Force & FIM Testing

As part of my goal to get reacquainted with SIEM tools and hands-on security practices, I decided to spin up **Wazuh** on my CentOS 9 lab environment and put its **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** and **Threat Detection** capabilities to the test.

## üß† Objective
Rebuild my comfort with SIEM platforms by simulating real-world security events like brute-force attacks and unauthorized file changes using open-source tools.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Setup

- **SIEM Platform:** Wazuh (deployed on CentOS 9)
- **Brute Force Simulator:** [Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) (cloned and compiled from source)
- **Test Targets:**
  - `testfile.txt` ‚Äî used to simulate file changes for integrity monitoring
  - `rockyou.txt` ‚Äî modified for brute-force wordlist with 1 valid password
  - `testuser` ‚Äî created as a temporary user for SSH brute-force testing

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I Did

1. **Installed Wazuh Server & Agent**
2. **Installed Hydra** with the `./configure` command and followed the prompts.
3. **Enabled File Integrity Monitoring** and designated `testfile.txt` as a watch target.
4. **Updated the Test File** with a simple `echo "ALERT TEST" >> /opt/testwatch.txt` command to append the file.
5. **Ran the Tail -f Command** on the .json file that was monitoring for file integrity checksum updates:
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.json | grep testwatch
   ```

6. **Created a test user** (`testuser`) on the system.
7. **Populated a wordlist** with many invalid entries and one correct password.
8. **Ran Hydra** to initiate an SSH brute-force attack:
   ```bash
   hydra -l testuser -P /path/to/rockyou.txt ssh://localhost
   ```
9. **Monitored activity** in both:
   - Wazuh‚Äôs **Threat Detection dashboard**
   - Wazuh Agent logs using `tail -f` on `/var/ossec/logs/ossec.log`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Happened

- Wazuh **successfully flagged the checksum change** on `testfile.txt` ‚Äî verifying the **FIM** setup worked.
- Hydra's brute-force attempt triggered:
  - **authentication failure alerts**
  - **MITRE ATT&CK mappings (T1110 & T1078)**
  - **Rule ID 5763** indicating a brute force login attempt
- At first, I thought Wazuh **wasn‚Äôt updating alerts** in the dashboard‚Äîbut it turns out `tail -f` was **holding the log file open in read mode** which delayed Wazuh's ability to parse and index those logs.
- Once I stopped `tail -f` and hit the **Refresh** button, the brute force alerts populated in the Wazuh dashboard instantly.

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- SIEM tools like Wazuh offer **clear and timely visibility** into file tampering and login abuse‚Äîespecially when properly configured.
- Simple tools like `Hydra` can help recreate **controlled adversarial simulations** to test alert coverage.
- **Log file handling matters**: holding files open can silently block detection pipelines from working correctly. This was a great reminder of how little things can impact big processes in log management.

## üß† Reflection

This exercise helped me reinforce concepts around:
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**
- **Brute force detection**
- **SIEM alert logic & tuning**
- **Behavioral detection mapped to MITRE ATT&CK**
